# ArcGIS Runtime OS X Preview Application

The ArcGIS Runtime Preview Application allows you to locate, view and interact with webmaps on a Mac OS X 10.8. It has been constructed from the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OS X. Feel free to use application or take advantage of it's source code located in ArcGIS Online.

This ArcGIS Runtime Preview application is built on the [Esri Application Framework](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=038213d942cc4db49b1c5bc716377721), or EAF. The EAF is a sample framework that contains course grained view controllers written on top of the Esri ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OS X.

To use the EAF Framework you must installed the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OS X 10.2 Beta.
